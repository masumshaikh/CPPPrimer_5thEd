I'm working through the exercises in one of the seminal books on C++: [C++ Primer, 5th Edition; by Lippman et al]([https://link-url-here.org](https://www.amazon.co.uk/C-Primer-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113)).

The book is admittedly quite old, and only covers up to the C++11 standard: I'm looking forward to the new edition comning out in 2025!

The code is annotated by lots of comments, as I realised very quickly on that I was going to have to go through the boook at least twice for the knowledge to "stick", and I didn't want to have to figure out everything from scratch the second time round.

This repo started as a personal back-up only, but some friends suggested I make it public in case it helps anyone else.

I welcome bug reports or pull requests in case I have made any mistakes.
